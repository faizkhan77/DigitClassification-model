# Digit Classification with Hyperparameter Tuning

Welcome to the Digit Classification project repository! In this project, the famous digits dataset from `sklearn.datasets` is utilized to classify digits using various classifiers. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to find the optimal parameters for the best-performing classifier. The following classifiers are explored: SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree.

## Project Overview

### Dataset

- **Digits Dataset:**
  - The dataset contains images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).
  - Loaded using `load_digits` from `sklearn.datasets`.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Data Splitting:**
  - The dataset is split into training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

### Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning

- **Classifier Exploration:**
  - Various classifiers, including SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree, are trained on the digit dataset.

- **GridSearchCV:**
  - Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to find the optimal parameters for each classifier.

### Model Comparison

- **Performance Evaluation:**
  - The performance of each classifier is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
  - The classifier with the best performance is identified.

## Project Execution

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/digit-classification.git
   cd digit-classification
   ```

2. **Run the Project:**
   - Execute the Jupyter Notebook (`digit_classification.ipynb`) in your preferred environment.

3. **Follow Notebook Instructions:**
   - Run the notebook cells sequentially to load the data, split it, train classifiers, perform hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate model performance.

4. **Find the Best Classifier and Parameters:**
   - Identify the classifier with the best performance and view the optimal hyperparameters found through GridSearchCV.
